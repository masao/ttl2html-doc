Welcome to ttl2html documentation!
==================================

**ttl2html** is a static site generator for Linked Data.

This tool accepts RDF/Turtle format as input to generate the corresponding HTML files.

`The Linked Data Principle <https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>` suggests that identifying things as HTTP URIs (resources) and resolving them on the Web is important.
This tool helps to generate a website for a Linked Data dataset and publish it on the Web.

Check out the :doc:`usage` and :doc:`configuration` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
